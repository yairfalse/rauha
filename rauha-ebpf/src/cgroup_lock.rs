//! cgroup_attach_task LSM hook — prevent zone escape.
//!
//! A task in a zone may be moved within its own zone's cgroup subtree,
//! but must not be moved to a cgroup belonging to a different zone.
//!
//! The shim enrollment flow is safe: the shim process runs unzoned
//! (inherits daemon's cgroup, not in ZONE_MEMBERSHIP), so its cgroup
//! writes to zone-{name}/cgroup.procs are allowed by the "not in a zone"
//! early return. The child blocks on the sync pipe until enrollment
//! completes, so it cannot act before cgroup assignment.
