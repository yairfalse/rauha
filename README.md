# Rauha

**Kernel-level enforcement and observability for container isolation.**

Docker gives you namespaces and cgroups. That's structural isolation — it sets up walls, but nothing watches the doors. A process can't see across a namespace boundary, but the kernel doesn't know that two containers *shouldn't* talk to each other. There's no enforcement at the syscall level, no audit trail of what was allowed or denied, no way to prove a workload stayed inside its boundary.

Rauha adds what's missing. Five eBPF LSM hooks run inside the kernel on every `open()`, `exec()`, `kill()`, `ptrace()`, and `cgroup_attach()`. Every call is checked against zone membership. Every deny is recorded with the process, the zone, and the target. This works on any cgroup-based workload — Rauha's own containers, or containers managed by containerd, Docker, or Kubernetes.

**Two ways to use Rauha:**

- **Rauha runtime** — a standalone container runtime where zones are first-class. Zones unify cgroups, namespaces, and eBPF enforcement under one API. Integrates with Kubernetes via a containerd shim v2. Linux uses eBPF LSM; macOS uses Virtualization.framework VMs.

- **Rauha enforce** *(coming soon)* — a lightweight agent that drops eBPF enforcement onto existing clusters. No runtime replacement needed. It watches containerd events, maps workloads to zones by label, and populates the same BPF maps. Your containers get kernel-level isolation enforcement without changing how you deploy them.

**Why this matters for AI infrastructure:**

AI agents execute arbitrary code. Training jobs touch sensitive data. Model weights are high-value IP. GPU workloads share nodes. The isolation story for all of this is "a Docker container" — which means a shared kernel and hope.

Rauha's eBPF hooks give you enforceable, auditable isolation: an agent sandbox where you can prove the agent never read files outside its zone. A training job where you have kernel-level evidence of which datasets were accessed. Millisecond zone startup with no VM boot overhead. Every enforcement decision streamed in real time for compliance and anomaly detection.

## The Zone Model

A zone is not a namespace. It's not a cgroup. It's the *concept* that ties them together.

└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Every container belongs to exactly one zone. Zones are the unit of:

| Concern | What it means |
|---------|---------------|
| **Visibility** | Processes in Zone A cannot see Zone B's processes |
| **Access** | Files, IPC, and signals cannot cross zone boundaries |
| **Networking** | Each zone gets its own IP, bridge connectivity, and firewall rules |
| **Resources** | CPU, memory, I/O, and PID limits scoped per zone |
| **Policy** | TOML-based, allow-list only, hot-reloadable without restart |

Cross-zone communication requires an explicit policy rule — allow-list, not deny-list.

## How It Works

### Linux: eBPF makes the kernel zone-aware

Rauha loads eBPF programs into kernel LSM hooks that enforce zone boundaries at the syscall level. Every `open()`, `kill()`, `connect()`, and `ptrace()` checks zone membership before proceeding.

```
Process in Zone A calls open("/data/file.txt")
  │
  ├─ kernel reaches file_open LSM hook
  ├─ rauha eBPF program fires
  ├─ lookup: process cgroup → zone_id = A
  ├─ lookup: file inode → file_zone = B
  ├─ A ≠ B → return -EACCES
  │
  └─ process gets "Permission denied"
```

This isn't a userspace check — it's enforced in the kernel on every access with no daemon round-trip. Policy changes are a BPF map update, not a process restart.

| eBPF Program | LSM Hook | Blocks |
|-------------|----------|--------|
| `rauha_file_open` | `file_open` | Cross-zone file access |
| `rauha_bprm_check` | `bprm_check_security` | Cross-zone binary execution |
| `rauha_ptrace_check` | `ptrace_access_check` | Cross-zone debugging/tracing |
| `rauha_task_kill` | `task_kill` | Cross-zone signals |
| `rauha_cgroup_attach` | `cgroup_attach_task` | Zone escape via cgroup manipulation |

Every deny is emitted to a ring buffer with the caller PID, zone IDs, and context (inode, cgroup ID) for audit and debugging.

Requires Linux 6.1+ with `CONFIG_BPF_LSM=y`.

### macOS: native VMs via Virtualization.framework

Each zone is a lightweight Linux VM — not a hidden shared VM like Docker Desktop. Each zone gets its own VM with hardware-enforced isolation.

The `rauha-guest-agent` runs inside each VM and manages container processes over virtio-vsock, using the same postcard IPC protocol as the Linux shim. APFS `clonefile()` provides instant, zero-copy rootfs clones. Network isolation uses pf firewall anchors per zone.

Same CLI. Same policy format. Same guarantees.

### Zone Networking

Each zone gets a unique IP from the `10.89.0.0/16` subnet. The `rauha0` bridge acts as gateway. nftables handles NAT masquerade for internet access and per-zone forward chains for traffic filtering.

```
Zone A (10.89.0.2)                    Zone B (10.89.0.3)
    │                                     │
  eth0 ──── veth-a ─┐       ┌── veth-b ── eth0
                    │       │
              ┌─────┴───────┴─────┐
              │     rauha0        │
              │   10.89.0.1/16    │
              │   (bridge+gw)     │
              └────────┬──────────┘
                       │
                 IP forwarding
                       │
                nftables NAT
                (masquerade)
                       │
                 host interface
                       │
                    internet
```

**Enforcement layering:** nftables handles packet filtering (L3/L4). eBPF `ZONE_ALLOWED_COMMS` map provides defense-in-depth for cross-zone socket operations. Network namespaces provide structural isolation. Three independent layers — if one is bypassed, the others still hold.

### The `IsolationBackend` trait

The key abstraction. Both backends implement the same interface — `rauhad` is platform-agnostic.

```rust
trait IsolationBackend: Send + Sync {
    fn create_zone(&self, config: &ZoneConfig) -> Result<ZoneHandle>;
    fn destroy_zone(&self, zone: &ZoneHandle) -> Result<()>;
    fn enforce_policy(&self, zone: &ZoneHandle, policy: &ZonePolicy) -> Result<()>;
    fn hot_reload_policy(&self, zone: &ZoneHandle, policy: &ZonePolicy) -> Result<()>;
    fn create_container(&self, zone: &ZoneHandle, spec: &ContainerSpec) -> Result<ContainerHandle>;
    fn start_container(&self, container: &ContainerHandle) -> Result<u32>;
    fn stop_container(&self, container: &ContainerHandle) -> Result<()>;
    fn zone_stats(&self, zone: &ZoneHandle) -> Result<ZoneStats>;
    fn verify_isolation(&self, zone: &ZoneHandle) -> Result<IsolationReport>;
    fn recover_zone(&self, zone: &ZoneHandle, zone_type: ZoneType, policy: &ZonePolicy) -> Result<()>;
    fn cleanup_orphans(&self, known_zones: &[ZoneHandle]) -> Result<()>;
    fn isolation_model(&self) -> IsolationModel; // SyscallPolicy | HardwareBoundary
    fn name(&self) -> &str;
}
```

### Crate Structure

| Crate | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `rauha-common` | Shared types, `IsolationBackend` trait, policy parsing, shim IPC protocol |
| `rauhad` | Daemon — gRPC server, zone registry, metadata (redb), networking, backends |
| `rauha-cli` | CLI binary |
| `rauha-shim` | Per-zone sync process — fork/run containers (Linux only) |
| `rauha-guest-agent` | Guest-side daemon inside macOS VMs |
| `rauha-oci` | OCI image pull, content store, rootfs preparation |
| `rauha-ebpf` | eBPF LSM programs (kernel-side, separate build) |
| `rauha-ebpf-common` | Shared `#[repr(C)]` types between eBPF and userspace |
| `containerd-shim-rauha-v2` | containerd shim v2 — bridges containerd to rauhad for Kubernetes |
| `rauha-enforce` | Standalone eBPF enforcement agent — drops onto existing clusters |
| `xtask` | Build helper for eBPF compilation |

### Kubernetes Integration

Rauha integrates with Kubernetes via a containerd shim v2. The `containerd-shim-rauha-v2` binary bridges containerd's Task ttrpc API to rauhad's gRPC API:

```
kubelet → containerd → containerd-shim-rauha-v2 (ttrpc) → rauhad (gRPC)
```

Sandbox creation maps to Rauha zone creation. Container operations map to Rauha container operations within that zone. Use `runtimeClassName: rauha` in pod specs.

### Enforcement Observability

Every deny decision from the 5 LSM hooks is emitted to a BPF ring buffer and streamed to userspace. Each event carries the timestamp, PID, caller zone, target zone, and hook-specific context (inode for file access, cgroup ID for cgroup escape attempts).

This provides:
- **Audit trails** — provable evidence that a workload never escaped its zone
- **Real-time visibility** — see enforcement decisions as they happen
- **Debugging** — understand exactly why access was denied

Enforcement counters (allow/deny/error per hook, per CPU) are always available for aggregate monitoring.

## Usage

```bash
# Create zones with policies
rauha zone create --name frontend --policy policies/standard.toml
rauha zone create --name database --policy policies/strict.toml

# Run containers in zones
rauha run --zone frontend nginx:latest
rauha run --zone database postgres:16

# Verify isolation
rauha zone verify frontend

# Image management
rauha image pull alpine:latest
rauha image ls
rauha image inspect alpine:latest

# Observe
rauha ps --zone frontend
rauha logs <container-id> --follow
rauha exec -it <container-id> /bin/sh
```

### Zone Policies

Declarative TOML. Allow-list model — nothing is permitted unless explicitly listed.

```toml
[zone]
name = "production"
type = "non-global"

[capabilities]
allowed = ["CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE", "CAP_CHOWN"]

[resources]
cpu_shares = 1024
memory_limit = "4Gi"
pids_max = 512

[network]
mode = "bridged"
allowed_zones = ["frontend"]
allowed_egress = ["0.0.0.0/0:443"]

[filesystem]
writable_paths = ["/data", "/tmp", "/var/log"]

[syscalls]
deny = ["mount", "umount2", "pivot_root"]
```

## Oracle Test Suite

Rauha includes a ground-truth oracle (`eval/oracle/`) — a standalone Rust binary that validates rauhad through its gRPC API. 55 numbered test cases across 11 categories. The oracle never reads source code, never mocks. When a case fails, it means the system's public contract is broken.

```bash
cd eval/oracle
RAUHA_GRPC_ENDPOINT=http://[::1]:9876 cargo test           # all cases
RAUHA_GRPC_ENDPOINT=http://[::1]:9876 cargo test -- case_001  # one case
```

| Range | Category | Cases |
|-------|----------|-------|
| 001-003 | Zone lifecycle | create, list, delete, duplicates |
| 004-006 | Container lifecycle | create, start, stop, exit |
| 007-009 | Image management | pull, inspect, remove |
| 010-012 | Isolation verification | healthy, nonexistent, policy reload |
| 013-015 | Policy enforcement | apply, memory limits, invalid rejection |
| 016-018 | Networking | bridged, host mode, DNS |
| 019-021 | Observability | stats, NotFound paths |
| 022-029 | Resilience | input validation (8 cases) |
| 030-034 | Multi-zone | coexistence, scoping, force-delete |
| 035-039 | Container edge cases | NotFound, invalid UUID |
| 040-054 | Invariants & stress | ID consistency, boundaries, rapid cycles |

## Building

```bash
# Build all workspace crates
cargo build

# Run unit tests
cargo test

# Start the daemon
RUST_LOG=rauhad=debug cargo run --bin rauhad

# macOS: sign after every build
codesign --entitlements rauhad/rauhad.entitlements -s - target/debug/rauhad

# Build eBPF programs (requires nightly)
cargo xtask build-ebpf
```

**Linux:** kernel 6.1+, `CONFIG_BPF_LSM=y`, `CONFIG_BPF_SYSCALL=y`, `CONFIG_DEBUG_INFO_BTF=y`, boot with `lsm=lockdown,capability,bpf`

**macOS:** macOS 15+ (Sequoia), Apple Silicon or Intel with VT-x, `com.apple.security.virtualization` entitlement

## Trade-offs

**eBPF is not a kernel primitive.** Zone identity is reconstructed via BPF map lookup on every enforcement call. Defended by the `zone_cgroup_lock` LSM hook, but it's defense-in-depth, not a hardware boundary.

**LSM is additive-only.** eBPF LSM programs can deny access but cannot override SELinux/AppArmor denials. Zone policy must be a subset of existing MAC policy.

**Struct offsets are resolved at load time.** eBPF programs read kernel struct fields (e.g., `file->f_inode`, `task_struct->cgroups`) via configurable offsets injected as globals by userspace. When `pahole` is available, real offsets are read from the running kernel's BTF and patched into the programs before loading — no rebuild needed for different kernels. A runtime self-test validates the offset chain on first execution. If pahole is not installed, sensible defaults for Linux 6.1+ are used.

**Covert channels** via shared kernel resources (CPU cache timing, memory pressure) are not addressable by eBPF. Same limitation as all OS-level isolation.

**IPv4 only.** Zone networking uses the `10.89.0.0/16` subnet. IPv6 addresses are not assigned to zones, and nftables rules only cover IPv4 traffic. Containers can reach IPv6 destinations via the host's network stack, but inter-zone IPv6 enforcement is not implemented.
