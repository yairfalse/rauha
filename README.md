# Rauha

**Give any agent a disposable, fully equipped computer for each task — without
Dockerfiles, credential hacks, or cleanup.**

Today, letting a coding agent work on a real repository means assembling a
Dockerfile, a bind-mounted checkout, a devcontainer, API keys, SSH agent
forwarding, a Docker socket, toolchains, caches, sidecars, cleanup scripts, and
hope. And Docker still only understands *a process in a container*. It does
not understand the piece of work the agent is trying to finish.

Rauha runs each agent task in its own **zone** — filesystem view, processes,
network, resources, policy, and audit as one unit — and hands back one
structured result: what ran, how it exited, what it produced, and what the
boundary stopped. Docker runs the process. Rauha operates the work.

> *Rauha* (Finnish) — *peace*. What you get when untrusted execution stays inside its boundary.

## What you get today

One command, one result:

```sh
rauha sandbox --image python:3.12 --repo-path . -- pytest tests/
```

```json
{
  "task_id": "task_123",
  "zone_id": "zone_456",
  "command": ["pytest", "tests/"],
  "status": "succeeded",
  "exit_code": 0,
  "duration_ms": 1842,
  "stdout": "...",
  "stderr": "",
  "admission": "strict",
  "unavailable_controls": [],
  "events": [],
  "enforcement_events": []
}
```

The daemon allocates a zone for the task, starts the container, waits, captures
stdout/stderr/exit code, collects lifecycle and enforcement events, and tears the
zone down unless you pass `--keep-zone`. **Strict admission is the default**: if
a control your policy asks for cannot be enforced on this host, the task is
refused rather than run degraded. `--audit` lets a temporary zone run anyway,
and the result says exactly which controls were missing.

Underneath, the same primitives are available directly:

```sh
rauha zone create --name frontend --policy policies/standard.toml
rauha run --zone frontend alpine:latest /bin/echo hello
rauha events                       # live zone + enforcement events
rauha zone verify frontend --json  # is the boundary actually intact?
```

See [`docs/architecture.md`](docs/architecture.md) for the full control surface.

## Where this is going

The zone is the boundary. The **run** is the product: agent, workspace,
authority, behaviour, and result as one portable, supervised object.

```sh
rauha run -- claude -p "upgrade Postgres and fix the migration"   # planned
rauha fork run-42 --agent codex                                    # planned
rauha compare run-43 run-44                                        # planned
rauha accept run-44                                                # planned
```

Rauha gives every agent a disposable computer, a set of trusted capabilities,
and a persistent supervisor that follows its work until it is genuinely
finished. Each run gets a copy-on-write workspace, brokered credentials it can
use but never read, proof gates, and a signed receipt of what was enforced.
Every run has a supervisor; an optional management layer makes it durable
across machines and teams. The full reasoning, market survey, and hardening roadmap are in
[`docs/positioning-and-roadmap.md`](docs/positioning-and-roadmap.md).

## Why not just Docker, or a hosted sandbox?

- **The task is the unit, not the container.** You reason about what the work
  did, not about a pile of container IDs.
- **Nothing degrades silently.** A requested control is enforced, audited, or
  the task is refused. The result always says which.
- **The boundary explains itself.** Logs, lifecycle, and kernel deny events
  come back through one watch API and one stable event schema
  ([`rauha-evidence`](docs/observability.md)). Isolation you cannot observe is
  isolation you cannot trust.
- **Crash recovery keeps the boundary.** Kill the daemon mid-task; on restart
  the same workload keeps its cgroup, kernel membership, and file ownership —
  probed on every Linux release.
- **Same model on your laptop and your cluster.** Linux builds zones from
  cgroups, namespaces, and an OCI rootfs, with Syvä enforcing in the kernel;
  macOS gives each zone its own VM. One daemon, one policy format, two backends.
- **Neutral.** Claude, Codex, or your own agent — Rauha does not care which.

## How it works

`rauhad` is a platform-agnostic daemon behind one `IsolationBackend` trait; the
`rauha` CLI and `containerd-shim-rauha-v2` are thin gRPC clients. On Linux,
`rauhad` spawns one `rauha-shim` per zone, which supervises `crun` for each
container and keeps lifecycle, logs, exec IPC, and evidence together. Zones get
their own network namespace, an IP on the `rauha0` bridge, and nftables rules
that default to drop. On macOS the zone is a Virtualization.framework VM with an
APFS-cloned rootfs and a guest agent over vsock.

Policy is TOML (`policies/standard.toml`): capabilities, resources, network mode
and egress, filesystem rules, devices, syscalls, and cross-zone communication.
Zone metadata lives in redb and is the source of truth on restart.

Details, diagram, and crate map: [`docs/architecture.md`](docs/architecture.md).

## Rauha and Syvä

**Rauha creates the zones. Syvä makes the Linux kernel respect them.**

| Rauha owns | Syvä owns |
| --- | --- |
| Runtime lifecycle, zone create/delete | Linux kernel enforcement (BPF-LSM) |
| Sandbox/container execution | eBPF programs, BPF maps, ring-buffer events |
| Policy loading and validation | file / exec / ptrace / signal / cgroup / capability deny decisions (socket is audit-only; nftables enforces network) |
| Image, rootfs, networking, metadata | per-hook counters and privileged self-tests |
| Logs, audit, user-facing event surfaces | the in-kernel deny-before-it-happens decision |
| Kubernetes / containerd integration | |

Syvä is a separate product ([`github.com/false-systems/syva`](https://github.com/false-systems/syva)).
`rauha-enforcer-api` defines the boundary as a backend-neutral trait with a
`NoopEnforcer` and a conformance harness every backend must pass. Today's state,
precisely: the in-repo Linux eBPF backend is what the daemon runs, an external
Syvä backend is not yet wired in, and routing live enforcement entirely through
the trait is in progress. **The seam is real, but not yet the sole enforcement
path.** See [`docs/rauha-syva-boundary.md`](docs/rauha-syva-boundary.md).

## Limitations (honest)

- **The run experience above is planned, not shipped.** What ships is
  `rauha sandbox` and the zone primitives. Fork, compare, accept, brokered
  credentials, and receipts are roadmap.
- **Three policy controls are unsupported on Linux today** and strict admission
  refuses them: `filesystem.writable_paths`, `devices.allowed`, `syscalls.deny`.
  The roadmap closes them with Landlock, cgroup device BPF, and seccomp.
- **Sandbox event capture is best-effort** — enforcement events ride a
  daemon-wide broadcast and can be absent or partial; they are not an
  audit-complete log.
- **A sandbox, not a hardware boundary** — BPF-LSM is OS-level isolation and is
  additive-only: it can deny, but cannot override SELinux/AppArmor. Covert
  channels through shared kernel resources are out of scope.
- **The two backends are different isolation models** — cgroups/namespaces on
  Linux vs. a VM per zone on macOS; they are not byte-for-byte equivalent.
- **Kubernetes integration requires containerd + RuntimeClass wiring**;
  installation docs and examples are still being written.

## Requirements

Rauha runs on Linux and macOS; full kernel enforcement is Linux-only.

- **Linux** — 6.1+ with `CONFIG_BPF_LSM=y`, `CONFIG_BPF_SYSCALL=y`,
  `CONFIG_DEBUG_INFO_BTF=y`; boot parameter `lsm=lockdown,capability,bpf`; BTF
  at `/sys/kernel/btf/vmlinux`. The Linux daemon
  **fails closed**: it requires root and a working BPF-LSM kernel and refuses to
  start without enforcement. There is no degraded Linux mode. For rootless
  local iteration, use the macOS backend.
- **macOS** — 15+ on Apple Silicon or Intel with VT-x. Sign `rauhad` after every
  build: `codesign --entitlements rauhad/rauhad.entitlements -s - target/debug/rauhad`.
  Install VM assets with `rauha setup`.

Root directory: `/var/lib/rauha` on Linux, `/tmp/rauha` on macOS (override with
`RAUHA_ROOT`).

## Build, test, and verify

```sh
cargo build                          # all workspace crates
cargo test                           # all unit tests
cargo xtask build-ebpf --release     # eBPF object + offsets sidecar for this kernel
RUST_LOG=rauhad=debug cargo run --bin rauhad   # daemon on [::1]:9876
```

Three layers of verification, each independent of the source:

- **Oracle** (`eval/oracle`, 55 numbered gRPC cases against a running daemon):
  `RAUHA_GRPC_ENDPOINT=http://[::1]:9876 cargo test`
- **Linux integration and security gate** (`tests/integration/`,
  `tests/security/linux-gate.sh`; root + BPF-LSM kernel): lifecycle, isolation,
  networking, crash recovery, and adversarial host-impact probes. On GitHub the
  privileged workflow installs the pinned Sykli evaluator from the private
  `false-systems/sykli` repository and needs a `SYKLI_READ_TOKEN` repository
  secret with `contents:read` there.
- **Enforcer conformance**: runs against `NoopEnforcer` in ordinary tests; the
  real eBPF backend is opt-in on an isolated root host with
  `RAUHA_RUN_EBPF_CONFORMANCE=1 cargo test -p rauhad linux_enforcer_passes_basic_conformance`.

## Roadmap

In order:

1. Finish safe user-namespace support on a runtime/storage combination that can
   make the rootfs private after entering the target user namespace.
2. Run Protocol v0 — the journal, reducer, lifecycle, ownership epochs,
   capability intents, checkpoints, forks, and adoption.
3. Local custodian and tier-0 supervisor with three built-in services:
   workspace, credential/egress broker, witness/receipt.
4. The `rauha run` experience: copy-on-write workspace, code diff plus
   behavioural diff, accept or discard.
5. Close the unsupported Linux controls (Landlock, cgroup device BPF, seccomp)
   and adopt the new mount API for rootfs assembly.
6. Signed execution receipts as an in-toto predicate; external Syvä backend
   through `rauha-enforcer-api`.
7. Optional management layer: durable runs across machines, fork/compare,
   Kubernetes `agent-sandbox` integration.
