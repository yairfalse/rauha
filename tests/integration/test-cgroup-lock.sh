# Integration test: cgroup_lock eBPF enforcement
#
# Verifies:
#   1. Same-zone cgroup move succeeds (container creation requires shim enrollment)
#   2. Cross-zone cgroup move is denied by eBPF cgroup_attach_task hook
#
# Requires: Linux, root, rauhad running with eBPF loaded, alpine image pulled.
# The cross-zone denial test only works when eBPF enforcement is active.
